**Companion App Progress & Next Steps**

---

## üöÄ What We‚Äôve Accomplished So Far

### 1. Initial Project Setup
- Scaffolded a TypeScript/React-based iframe host app.
- Configured Tailwind (including neurodivergent-friendly tokens) and basic layout.
- Added `window.C42_SDK` detection logic to gracefully fall back to standalone mode.  

### 2. Core UI Components
- **Theme & Language Subscriptions**: Implemented `sdk.subscribe('theme_change')` and `sdk.subscribe('language_change')` hooks to sync UI.
- **Request Flow**: Built `getAIResponse(topic)` wrapper around `sdk.request('generate_response')` with error handling.
- **Community App Shell**: Created `community_app.html` demo showing secure SDK initialization and response rendering.

### 3. UX & Accessibility
- Applied neurodivergent-optimized design tokens (focus-visible, spacing, color hierarchy).
- Ensured predictable, calm animations (`fade-in`, `pulse-slow`).
- Defined core navigation and card components (agent cards, standard cards) consistent with the C42 design system.

### 4. Security & Sandbox
- Verified zero external network connections; all data routed through the Kernel SDK.
- Established iframe sandboxing pattern for secure inter-app communication.
- Hardened message router paths (`postMessage`-only) and validated origin checks.

## üèóÔ∏è What Still Needs Doing

1. **Dependency & Build Fixes**
   - ‚úÖ **Resolved**: React version conflict in import map (standardized on v18).
   - Consolidate toolchain: choose either Vite or Next.js and remove redundant configs.

2. **Env & Secrets Management**
   - Migrate `process.env` usage to Vite-compatible env variables or dynamic user input.
   - Securely expose only necessary API scopes via the SDK instead of embedding keys.

3. **Feature Development**
   - **Interactive Chat UI**: Build a conversational interface around the AI response pipeline.
   - **Topic Selector & History**: Persist recent topics, support bookmarking & search.
   - **Offline Mode**: Gracefully handle SDK absence and queue requests for later.

4. **Testing & Quality**
   - Write end-to-end tests for SDK integration flows (theme, language, generate_response).
   - Add visual regression tests for neuro-friendly components.
   - Perform accessibility audits (WCAG compliance) with focus on cognitive accessibility.

5. **Performance & Optimization**
   - Lazy-load heavy modules (e.g., AI response renderer, charts).
   - Profile and optimize initial bundle size for quick iframe startup.
   - Implement code-splitting by feature routes.

6. **Documentation & Examples**
   - Expand README with setup instructions and coding examples.
   - Create tutorial video or interactive demo showing end-to-end flow.
   - Document contribution guidelines specific to the companion app repo.

7. **Release & Deployment**
   - Configure CI/CD pipeline to automatically deploy to Cloud Run or static hosting.
   - Tag a v1.0.0 release and publish packaged SDK-ready version.
